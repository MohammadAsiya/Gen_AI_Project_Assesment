Course Title: Hypothesis Testing for Data Science and Analytics

Title Description: Hypothesis testing is one of the most fascinating and essential steps data scientists perform! Learn the basics of hypothesis testing and how to implement them in your project!

Course Description:

Statistics is the foundation for data science and machine learning. Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical concept that allows you to validate your ideas and make data-driven decisions. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to hypothesis testing, covering the essential concepts, methods, and applications in data science.

What you will learn:

Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing: Understand the core concepts of hypothesis testing, including null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, Type 1 and Type 2 errors, and significance level.
p-value: Learn how to interpret p-values and make statistical inferences based on your data.
Z-Test: Master the Z-test, a fundamental hypothesis testing method for normally distributed data.
t-Test: Explore the t-test, another widely used hypothesis testing method that works well with smaller datasets or data with unknown population variance.
Choosing the Right Test: Gain insights into selecting the appropriate test (Z-test or t-test) based on your data characteristics.
Case Study: Hypothesis Testing for Coronavirus in Python: Apply your theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario. You'll work on a case study involving hypothesis testing on a coronavirus dataset using Python.
Prerequisites:

A basic understanding of descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation) is recommended.
Prior experience with Python is beneficial but not mandatory.
